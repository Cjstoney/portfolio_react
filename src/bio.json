I have since begun working in web development, using my art and woodworking past to inform how I build websites from start to finish.  After growing up in the Bay Area, I spent three years at The San Francisco Art Institute studying Fine Art with an emphasis in painting and photography.After I graduated, I moved to Portland with my wife and our friend where I got a job as a production woodworker, helping to build custom greenhouses. After three years I decided to learn web development and transition careers. "
