          I am Camerone Stoney. I moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to
          Portland, Oregon in 2015. While in the Bay Area, I studied Fine Art
          with an emphasis in painting at The San Francisco Art Institute. After
          moving to Portland, I worked for three years as a fine woodworker. I
          have since begun working in web development, using my art background
          to influence my aesthetic choices and my woodworking production
          knowledge to build websites from start to finish.{" "}
